## Tidy data

Bij definition, (video 03_04_reshapingData, page 2), tidy data complies to:

*each variable forms a column
*each observation forms a row
*each table stores one type of observation (e.g. here body movements)

In below data set there are no variables as a row attribute, all observations are in rows (aggregated to activity and subject, no observations are columnwise and the table only stores data on body movements. Therefore it is tidy.


## Key/grouping attributes

* activity: (type = character, possible values = WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING
* subject: (type = integer, possible values 1:30). comment: each ID refers to a specific person. 

## Variables

The below variables are aggregates of measures, aggregated by above activity and subject. Within each group of activity and subject the mean value of the original measures has been calculated. Therefore the below variables are indicated with the prefix "mean-of-". 

The original vaiables are described by the code book belonging to the following data set provided by UCI:
